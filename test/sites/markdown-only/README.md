# Markdown Only Test

This documentation site has no `_sidebar.md`, no `cover.md`, no `_topbar.md`, no catalog and no keyword index.

It is the simplest possible pict-docuserve site: just a folder of markdown files.

## What Should Happen

- The splash page should derive its title from this README heading
- The sidebar should show a single "Markdown Only Test" group
- There should be a "Read the Docs" action button on the splash page
- Clicking it should navigate to this README content
- Navigation to other pages should work via `#/page/<name>` routes
